# EmailNotify

A WordPress notification plugin

This utility sends an email notification to a predefined list of recipients whenever a new blog post is published.


## Installation

1. Extract ```cron``` somewhere on your system - not in a location accessible from the web!

2. Import the database schema into your local system, paying attention to the WordPress prefix (default wp_)

3. Place ```index.php``` in the directory ```wp-content/emailnotify```

4. Log into WordPress and activate the plugin

5. Place entries similar to this in your local Crontab, and adjust the paths as required to match your system

```
*/10 * * * * /usr/local/bin/php /path/to/cron/send_batch_emails.php > /dev/null
*/15 * * * * /usr/bin/fetch -q -o - "https://blog.example.com/wp-cron.php?doing_wp_cron" > /dev/null 2>&1
```

Note that ```fetch``` is the default on FreeBSD; on Linux ```wget``` is a viable alternative.
